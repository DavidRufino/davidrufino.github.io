    <p> &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source
        form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media
        types.</p>

    <p> &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the
        License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided
        in the Appendix below).</p>

    <p> &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived
        from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall
        not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work
        and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

    <p> &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any
        modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor

        as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</p>

    <p> &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution
        has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>

    <p>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
        grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
        reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work
        and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

    <p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
        to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
        section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
        counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
        direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that
        Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

    <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
        with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
    </p>

    <p> (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

    <p> (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</p>

    <p> (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
        trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
        to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>

    <p> (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works
        that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
        following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form
        or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
        Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
        Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>

    <p> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license
        terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative
        Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
        conditions stated in this License.</p>

    <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
        for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    </p>

    <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
        product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
        the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

    <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work
        (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
        CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
        determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
        exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

    <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
        contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
        special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
        use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
        computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
        choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
        agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
